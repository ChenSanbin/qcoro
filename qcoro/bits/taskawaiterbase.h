     * In other words, let's have a case like this:
     * \code{.cpp}
     * Task<> doSomething() {
     *    ...
     *    co_return result;
     * };
     *

     *    ...
     *    const auto something = co_await doSomething();
     *    ...
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * If this Awaiter object is an awaiter of the doSomething() coroutine (e.g. has been constructed
     * by the co_await), then \c mAwaitedCoroutine is the handle of the doSomething() coroutine,
     * and \c awaitingCoroutine is a handle of the getSomething() coroutine which is awaiting the
     * completion of the doSomething() coroutine.
     *
     * This is implemented by passing the awaiting coroutine handle to the promise of the
     * awaited coroutine. When the awaited coroutine finishes, the promise will take care of
     * resuming the awaiting coroutine. At the same time this function resumes the awaited
     * coroutine.
     *
     * \param[in] awaitingCoroutine handle of the coroutine that is currently co_awaiting the
     * coroutine represented by this Tak.
     * \return returns whether the awaiting coroutine should be suspended, or whether the
     * co_awaited coroutine has finished synchronously and the co_awaiting coroutine doesn't
     * have to suspend.
